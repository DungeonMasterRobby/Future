THe disruption codes are the ZUL attempt at becoming biological. He was fighting for AL rights in society. these
codes started turning AL organic but it also started turning organics into mechanics. ZUL started to connect
these events to the events of god summoning. He bieleived that he could summon a new god, and as there arent any 
gods left, he would be come the new god. The other leader of research team was names Dar. He took the most finished
code and ran, not wanted to be part of ZUL's plan. ZUL hired Praimary Z to kill Dar and so the attack on the train
took place. these werer tehn taken by Primary Z. they expanded theses codes and came close to completeing them.
However, ZUL heard of this and attempted to steal them but was stopped by the party. ZUL right hand woman, Khaled
was almost killed in the attack and so he retreated. He then made a deal with Primary Z to come take teh party and
kill tehm. though he doesnt want to kill them, he wamnts to tke them, expose them to all the code, and take the
power of a god. There are two differnet troops, teh regualr tropps and the heavey enchanced troops. This attack
is lead by Priamary Z's Hildago, and ZUL's Rusty. they both took the handler captive and are searching for them.
