For all implants, there is the base model that is needed for the implant. This is the base model or Mark X. 
The Mark X level allows that many additonal implants to be made. These are the formula implants. The Mark are limited
by the characters CON score. Each Mark cost its Mark level in CON score, i.e. a character with CON 12 is limited 
at 2 Mark V and a Mark II total implants. This does not lower the characters mana pool. After the implantaion of
the Mark X base implant, the can imlant as many Formula Y implants as the Mark X can handle and if the character's
mana pool in non-negative. The Formula Y implant lower the mana pool by {R | R = (Y + Y-1 + Y-2 +...+ 1 + 0)} for each
Mark X that is implanted.
